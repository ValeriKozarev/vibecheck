# vibecheck
visualize audio features of spotify playlists to find that perfect vibe

## TODOs:
* decided this app is simple enough to not need redux -> need to add the playlist section to display info about an individual playlist 
* spiderchart (JS or separate R script?)
* organize playlist view to show spiderchart and high-level insights
* organize project
* need to figure out best practice for .env file
* package nicely for others to use :^)
